# simplest-MNIST-TensorFlow
The simplest TensorFlow tutorial for classification of MNIST dataset using neural networks in TensorFlow.

## Overview
This repository is a very basic implementation of neural networks using TensorFlow on the "hello world" of deep-learning- the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) handwritten digits dataset.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of Python and numpy.
- This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of neural networks and the related terminology like weights, bias, layers etc. along with an understanding of how forward propagation works and a brief idea of how backward propagation is used to update our parameters. (Every mathematical detail related to neural networks is not required.)

## Dependencies
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
